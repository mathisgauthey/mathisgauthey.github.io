# Leatherman Wave+, Charge+ and Charge+ TTI Comparison

In this post, I'll show my researches about the difference between many Leatherman bestsellers, and why I ended up buying the Wave+.

<!-- more -->

Hi everyone, as I compared these bad boys before buying my first leatherman, I might as well share it! I'm just stating the pros and cons of each of the three options on the title, because they basically have almost the same tools.

## Wave+

### Pros

- Rounder finish, helps to get a better hold and apply more force to the pliers.

## Charge+

### Pros Over the Wave+

- Better knife blade (154CM steel instead of 420HC one) (<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-pGckfXhWk> for more information).
- Gut hook on the serrated blade, useful to cut strings in a safer way and for butchering an animal.
- Classy finish with handgrips. Might be harder to put pressure on it, but better grip and finish.
- Pocket clip is sold with the Charge+.
- The molle sheath has two pockets for lights and or pens, the wave doesn't have additional pockets.
- Partial bit kit is added with the most useful bits (<https://www.knivesandtools.fr/fr/pt/-leatherman-charge-plus-pince-multifonction-etui-en-nylon.htm>).

### Cons Over the Wave+

- The crimper might be harder to use because the protections around the tool are heavier and bulkier, hence you'll triple crimp sometimes.
- Bulkier. Like he really feels bigger.

## Charge+ TTI

### Pros Over the Charge+

- Lighter (really small difference).
- Premium finish.
- Better knife blade (S30V steel instead of 154CM one) (<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-pGckfXhWk> for more information). Small upgrade over the 154CM one, while the 420HC is last by far (3 to 4 times worse edge retention).

### Cons Over the Charge+

- The plier might break easily because of the additional crimper on it. At least many people said that.

## Conclusion

Basically, each one is an upgrade from the other one. But these upgrades are not useful for everyone and should be considered as the price increase is quite huge.

I ended up buying a Wave+ because I don't need the hook, I needed the full bit kit anyway, I have a tactical pouch where I'll put it so I don't need the sheath, and if the blade isn't as good as the others to cut through ropes and card boxes, I'll use the serrated blade anyway so it is not a problem.

In addition, I recommend buying a Work Sharp Guided Field Sharpener for sharpening your leatherman : <https://www.worksharptools.com/shop/benchtop/manual/guided-field-sharpener/>

Have a nice day, hope it helps !
